    Fits a ppoly to the provided raw data.
    t_x_y_z_yaw is the raw interpolated data that we need to organize into number_of_segments polynomials.
    We can use two (three) methods:
    1.a:
    "bspline", with recalculate set to False is the equivalent of the "old" skyc_utils method. This fits a spline
    to the data points using splrep, and then converts the BSpline to a PPoly. There are two issues:
    -Since we have to use a set number of knots, the fit won't be exact, and this means that the start and end
    points may differ from the start and end points of the given data. This means that when we are fitting together
    trajectory methods made this way, they may not link up perfectly. Some controllers are sensitive to this (like
    geometric and mellinger)
    -We can only fit up to degree 5
    1.b:
    "bspline", with recalculate set to True adds weights to the ends of the trajectory, forcing them to be closer
    to the data points. It will do this as many times as it takes to get a good fit at the start and end, raising
    the weights each time. This means that trajectory segments will link up nicely, but will take a longer time to Å±
    calculate.
    -We can only fit up to degree 5 still
    2:
    "lsqspline": fits a spline of any degree (!) to the data, then replaces the first and last segments with
    segments calculated by hand, that link up to the data points' start and end perfectly. In theory this is better
    in every way than method 1, but it hasn't been tested as much.
